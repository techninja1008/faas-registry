## Function as a Service Language

The following is a working draft of the latest FaaSlang specification, version
**0.1.x**, dated **May 10th, 2017**.

FaaSlang is a simple **open specification** intended to define semantics and
implementation details around FaaS ("serverless") functions, gateways and
client interfaces (requests from any language / SDK). It has been designed with
the goal of decreasing organizational complexity around FaaS microservices by
encouraging simple conventions for how we document and interface with them,
**including type safety mechanisms**. In the same way GraphQL is intended to
provide opinions and a specification for the way developers interface with
nested relational (graph) data, FaaSlang does the same for FaaS resources.

If you use a FaaSlang-compliant deployment and API gateway (for example, as
  used by https://stdlib.com) you get the following benefits over traditional
  gateways for serverless functions:

- Standard Calling Conventions (HTTP)
- Type Safety
- Enforced Documentation
- Background Execution (immediately return response, run logic as a worker)

And that's just the beginning. All of the goodies you're looking for like
rate limiting, authentication, etc. are not part of the FaaSlang specification
but can easily be added to the example provided in this repository.

# What is FaaSlang?

To put it simply, FaaSlang defines semantics and rules for a "serverless"
function deployment and execution (API) gateway to turn this:

```javascript
// hello_world.js

/**
* My hello world function!
*/
module.exports = function (name = 'world', callback) {

  callback(null, `hello ${world}`);

};
```

Into an infinitely scalable web API (using "serverless" providers) that can
be called over HTTP like this (GET):

```
https://myhost.com/username/servicename/hello_world?name=joe
```

Or like this (POST):

```json
{
  "name": "joe"
}
```

And gives a result like this:

```json
"hello joe"
```

Or, when a type mismatch occurs (like `{"name":10}`):

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type":"ParameterError"
    ...
  }
}
```

# Why FaaSlang?

The "serverless" space is growing rapidly, and as it grows, so do the toolchains
required to keep up. Each infrastructure provider imposes its own
standard and way of doing things around FaaS to the point we're relying on
individual developers to pick and choose the best framework for deployment.

FaaSlang takes a different approach, and offers a specification for an API
Gateway (and a reasonably robust, non-vendor-specific Node.js implementation of
such) that acts as a way to "lock in" the way you and your team members
deploy to and execute your "serverless" functions.

Take a current example of an AWS Lambda function **(A)**;

```javascript
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
  let myVar = event.myVar;
  let requiredVar = event.requiredVar;
  myVar = myVar === undefined ? 1 : myVar;
  callback(null, 'Hello from Lambda!');
};
```

Or a Microsoft Azure function **(B)**;

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, req) {
  let myVar = req.query.myVar || req.body && req.body.myVar;
  let requiredVar = req.query.requiredVar || req.body && req.body.requiredVar;
  myVar = myVar === undefined ? 1 : myVar;
  context.res = {body: 'Hello from Microsoft Azure!'};
  context.done();
}
```

FaaSlang instead defines the Node.js function footprint;

```javascript
/**
* @param {Number} myVar A number
* @param {String} requiredVar must be a string!
* @returns {String}
*/
module.exports = (myVar = 1, requiredVar, context, callback) => {
  callback(null, 'Hello from FaaSlang-compliant service vendor.');
};
```

Where **comments are used as part of the semantic definition** for type-safety
(if they can't be inferred from defaults), expected parameters can be
specifically defined, and you still have an optional `context` object for
more robust execution (argument overloading, etc.)

Here's what the current FaaS workflow looks like:

And this is what a FaaSlang-enabled workflow looks like.

![FaaSlang Workflow](/images/faaslang-workflow.jpg)

FaaSlang is the result of tens of thousands of FaaS deployments, by thousands of
developers, spread across a number of cloud service providers and the need to
standardize our ability to organize and communicate with these functions.

# Specification

## FaaSlang Resource Definition

A FaaSlang definition is a `definition.json` file that respects the following
format.

Given a function like this (filename `my_function.js`):

```javascript
/**
* This is my function, it likes the greek alphabet
* @param {String} alpha Some letters, I guess
* @param {Number} beta And a number
* @param {Boolean} gamma True or false?
* @return {Object} some value
*/
module.exports = async function my_function (alpha, beta = 2, gamma, context) {
  /* your code */
};
```

You would provide a function definition that looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my_function",
  "format": {
    "language": "nodejs",
    "async": true
  },
  "description": "This is my function, it likes the greek alphabet",
  "bg": {
    "mode": "info",
    "value": ""
  },
  "charge": 1,
  "context": null,
  "params": [
    {
      "name": "alpha",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Some letters, I guess"
    },
    {
      "name": "beta",
      "type": "number",
      "defaultValue": 2,
      "description": "And a number"
    },
    {
      "name": "gamma",
      "type": "boolean",
      "description": "True or false?"
    }
  ],
  "returns": {
    "type": "object",
    "description": "some value"
  }
}
```

This definition is *extensible*, meaning you can add additional fields to it,
but it **must** obey this schema.

A definition must implement the following fields;

| Field | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| name | A user-readable function name (used to execute the function), must match `/[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*/i` |
| format | An object requiring a `language` field, along with any implementation details |
| description | A brief description of what the function does, can be empty (`""`) |
| bg | An object containing "mode" and "value" parameters specifying the behavior of function responses when executed in the background |
| charge | An integer between 0 and 100 defining the cost (arbitrary units) to run this function, charged to authenticated users |
| params | An array of `NamedParameter`s, representing function arguments
| returns | A `Parameter` without a `defaultValue` representing function return value |

## Context Definition

If the function does not access execution context details, this should always
be null. If it is an object, it indicates that the function *does* access
context details (i.e. `remoteAddress`, http headers, etc. - see [Context](#context)).

This object **does not have to be empty**, it can contain vendor-specific
details; for example `"context": {"user": ["id", "email"]}` may indicate
that the execution context specifically accesses authenticated user id and email
addresses.

## Parameters

Parameters have the following format;

| Field | Required | Definition |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| name | NamedParameter Only | The name of the Parameter, must match `/[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*/i` |
| type | yes | A string representing a valid FaaSlang type |
| description | yes | A short description of the parameter, can be empty string (`""`) |
| defaultValue | no | Must match the specified type, **if not provided this parameter is required** |

### Constraints

The **first parameter can never be of type "Object"**. This is to ensure
request consistency with generic calls (i.e. support for argument overloading)
across all language implementations.

### Types

As FaaSlang is intended to be polyglot, functions defined with it must have
a strongly typed signature. Not all types are guaranteed to be consumable in
the same way in every language, and we will continue to define specifications
for how each language should interface with FaaSlang types. At present,
the types are a limited superset of JSON values.

| Type | Definition | Example Input Values (JSON) |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------- |
| boolean | True or False | `true` or `false` |
| string | Basic text or character strings | `"hello"`, `"GOODBYE!"` |
| number | Any double-precision [Floating Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point) value | `2e+100`, `1.02`, `-5` |
| float | Alias for `number` | `2e+100`, `1.02`, `-5` |
| integer | Subset of `number`, integers between `-2^53 + 1` and `+2^53 - 1` (inclusive) | `0`, `-5`, `2000` |
| object | Any JSON-serializable Object | `{}`, `{"a":true}`, `{"hello":["world"]}` |
| array | Any JSON-serializable Array | `[]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, `[{"a":true}, null, 5]` |
| buffer | Raw binary octet (byte) data representing a file | `{"_bytes": [8, 255]}` or `{"_base64": "d2h5IGRpZCB5b3UgcGFyc2UgdGhpcz8/"}` |
| any | Any value mentioned above | `5`, `"hello"`, `[]` |

### Type Conversion

The `buffer` type will automatically be converted from any `object` with a
**single key-value pair matching the footprints** `{"_bytes": []}` or `{"_base64": ""}`.

Otherwise, parameters provided to a function are expected to match their
defined types. Requests made over HTTP via query parameters or POST data
with type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` will be automatically
converted from strings to their respective expected types, when possible
(see [FaaSlang Resource Requests](#faaslang-resource-requests) below):

| Type | Conversion Rule |
| ---- | --------------- |
| boolean | `"t"` and `"true"` become `true`, `"f"` and `"false"` become `false`, otherwise **do not convert** |
| string | No conversion |
| number | Determine float value, if NaN **do not convert**, otherwise convert |
| float | Determine float value, if NaN **do not convert**, otherwise convert |
| integer | Determine float value, if NaN **do not convert**, may fail integer type check if not in range |
| object | Parse as JSON, if invalid **do not convert**, object may fail type check (array, buffer) |
| array | Parse as JSON, if invalid **do not convert**, object may fail type check (object, buffer) |
| buffer | Parse as JSON, if invalid **do not convert**, object may fail type check (object, array) |
| any | No conversion |

### Nullability

All types are nullable, but **nullability can only be specified** by setting
`"defaultValue": null` in the `NamedParameter` definition. That is to say,
if a default value is provided, the type is no longer nullable.

## FaaSlang Resource Requests

FaaSlang-compliant requests *must* complete the following steps;

1. Ensure the **Resource Definition** is valid and compliant, either on storage
    or accession.
1. Performs a handshake (i.e. HTTP) with initial request details
1. Accept an `Array`, `Object` or a string of URLencoded variables
1. If over HTTP and query parameters present, query parameters used as
   URL encoded variables
1. If over HTTP POST and query parameters present, reject requests that try to
   specify a POST body as well with a `ClientError`
1. If over HTTP POST, requests **must** include a `Content-Type` header or
   a `ClientError` is immediately returned
1. If over HTTP POST, `Content-Type` **must** be `application/json` for `Array`
   or `Object` data, or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for string data or
   a `ClientError` is immediately returned
1. If `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` values are provided (either via POST
   body or query parameters), convert types based on [Type Conversion](#type-conversion)
   and knowledge of the function definition and create an `Object`
1. If `Array`: Parameters will be checked for type consistency in the order of
   the definition `params`
1. If `Object`: Parameters will be checked for type consistency based on names
   of the definition `params`
1. If any inconsistencies are found, cease execution and immediately return a
   `ParameterError`
1. If a parameter has no defaultValue specified and is not provided, immediately
   return a `ParameterError`
1. Try to execute the function, if the function fails to parse or is not valid,
   immediately return a `FatalError`
1. If a function hits a specified timeout (execution time limit), immediately
   return a `FatalError`
1. If a function returns an error (via callback) or one is thrown and not caught,
   immediately return a `RuntimeError`
1. If function returns inconsistent response (does not match `returns` type),
   immediately return a `ValueError`
1. If no errors are encountered, return the value to the client
1. If over HTTP and `content-type` is not being overloaded (i.e. developer
   specified through a vendor-specific mechanism), return `buffer` type data as
   `application/octet-stream` and any other values as `application/json`.

### Context

Every function intended to be consumed via FaaSlang has the option to specify
an *optional* magic `context` parameter that receives vendor-specific
information about the function execution context - for example, if consumed over
HTTP, header details. FaaSlang definitions must specify whether or not they
consume a `context` object. Context objects are extensible but **MUST** contain
the following fields;

| Field | Definition |
| ----- | ---------- |
| params | An `object` mapping called parameter names to their values |
| http | `null` if not accessed via http, otherwise an `object` |
| http.headers | If accessed via HTTP, an `object` containing header values |

### Errors

Errors returned by FaaSlang-compliant services must follow the following JSON
format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ClientError",
    "message": "You know nothing, Jon Snow",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

`details` is an optional object that can provide additional Parameter details.
Valid Error types are:

- `ClientError`
- `ParameterError`
- `FatalError`
- `RuntimeError`
- `ValueError`

#### ClientError

`ClientError`s are returned as a result of bad or malformed client data,
  including lack of authorization or a missing function (not found). If over
  HTTP, they **must** returns status codes in the range of `4xx`.

#### ParameterError

`ParameterError`s are a result of Parameters not passing type-safety checks,
  and **must** return status code `400` if over HTTP.

Parameter Errors **must** have the following format;

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ParameterError",
    "message": "ParameterError",
    "details": {...}
  }
}
```

`"details"` should be an object mapping parameter names to their respective
validation (type-checking) errors. Currently, this specification defines
two classifications of a ParameterError for a parameter; *required* and
*invalid*. The format of `"details": {}` should follow this format;

##### Details: Required

```json
{
  "param_name": {
    "message": "((descriptive message stating parameter is required))",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

##### Details: Invalid

```json
{
  "param_name": {
    "message": "((descriptive message stating parameter is invalid))",
    "invalid": true,
    "expected": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "actual": {
      "type": "string",
      "value": "hello world"
    }
  }
}
```

#### FatalError

`FatalError`s are a result of function mismanagement - either your function
  could not be loaded, executed, or it timed out. These **must** return status
  code `500` if over HTTP.

#### RuntimeError

`RuntimeError`s are a result of uncaught exceptions in your code as it runs,
  including errors you explicitly choose to throw (or send to clients via a
  callback, for example). These **must** return status code `403` if over
  HTTP.

#### ValueError

`ValueError`s are a result of your function returning an unexpected value
  based on FaaSlang type-safety mechanisms. These **must** return status code
  `502` if over HTTP.

`ValueError` looks like an *invalid* ParameterError, where the `details`
Object only ever contains a single key called `"returns"`. These are encountered
due to implementation issues on the part of the function developer.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "ValueError",
    "message": "ValueError",
    "details": {
      "returns": {
        "message": "((descriptive message stating return value is invalid))",
        "invalid": true,
        "expected": {
          "type": "boolean"
        },
        "actual": {
          "type": "number",
          "value": 2017
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

# FaaSlang Server and Gateway: Implementation

A fully-compliant FaaSlang gateway (that just uses local function resources)
is available with this package, simply clone it and run `npm test` or look
at the `/tests` folder for more information.

The current FaaSlang specification is used in production by the FaaS
provider [StdLib](https://stdlib.com), and is available for local use with the
[StdLib CLI Package](https://github.com/stdlib/lib) which relies on this
repository as a dependency.
